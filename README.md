## Story

I am not good at writing. That is why I created [Penelope AI](https://penelopeai.com/).

But I thought it might also be possible to help writers from another perspective. In other words, I would like to have AI write rough drafts and then have humans make corrections.

This idea inspired me to create [AutoWrite](https://auto-write.vercel.app/) for this hackathon. Due to time constraints, there are many features that could not be implemented, such as time zone support. For now, this is just an MVP 😅

## Supabase Usage

1. Supabase Auth - to handle user
2. Supabase DB - to store project data and cron job
3. Supabase Edge Function - for users to fetch their articles data

### 🔨 Built With

- [Next.js app dir](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
- [Render](https://render.com/)
